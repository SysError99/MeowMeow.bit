# MeowMeow.bit
A decentralized social network that mainly focuses on you.

This project is still under development. Many core features are still missing.
---

## Advantages
1. Ad-free, since we don't use any types of centralized server (besides of tracker server, which you can make your own)
2. Censorship is under your control, using keywords or limited characters, can also be configured to be censorship-free.
3. Torrent-based, anyone who follows you also hosts your data, but data rights are yours.
4. ToS-free platform, because the platform owner is you.

## Core features
- Content filtering.
- Direct Message.
- Personal board for your posts.
- Public board for public posts, also under your control.

## Not-promised features, but maybe I will implement them later
- Board reputation, to check board transparency.
- Digital contract for transactions.
- Tor support for anonymity.
