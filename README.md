# MeowMeow.bit
A decentralized social network that mainly focuses on you.

This project is still under development. Many core features are still missing.
---

## Advantages
1. Ad-free, since we don't use any types of centralized server (besides of tracker server, which you can make your own)
2. Censorship is under your control, using keywords or limited characters, can also be configured to be censorship-free.
3. Filter any contents you don't want to see, or just make it fully open, can't be done on regular social network platforms!
4. Torrent-based, anyone who follows you also hosts your data, but data rights are yours.
5. ToS-free platform, because the platform owner is you.

## Core features
- Basic interactions (like, comment, and share)
- Content filtering.
- Direct Message.
- Discover boards from trackers.
- Personal board for your posts.
- Public board for public posts, under your control.

## Not-promised features, but maybe I will implement them later
- Board reputation, to check board transparency.
- Digital contract for transactions.
- Tor support for anonymity.
